# Welcome to My Week 2 Project at Lux Academy and DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp Program

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the WeatherData.csv dataset to gain insights into weather conditions, visibility and many more. In the analysis I used Python libraries; pandas for data manipulation and seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations.

### Project Structure
  - `WeatherData.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
  - `Week2_Project`.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook contains the code and explanations for the analysis.


- The dataset contains columns; Weather, Date/Time,	Temp_C,	Dew Point Temp_C,	Rel Hum_%,	Wind Speed_km/h,	Visibility_km,	Press_kPa.
- I added the Months column into the dataframe as I was doing the analysis.
- At the end of the notebook I wrote the insights I gained during the analysis.
