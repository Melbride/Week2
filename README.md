# Welcome to My Week 2 Project at Lux Academy and DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp Program

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the WeatherData.csv dataset to gain insights into weather conditions and visibility. The analysis uses Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations.

### Project Structure

  - `Week2_Project`.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the analysis.


- The dataset contains columns; Weather, Date/Time	Temp_C	Dew Point Temp_C	Rel Hum_%	Wind Speed_km/h	Visibility_km	Press_kPa, Months.
